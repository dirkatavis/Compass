## TODO Backlog Convention

We will capture TODOs during development using the following format:

```
# TODO[category][priority]: short action-oriented description
```

**Categories:**
- refactor â€” restructure existing code
- perf â€” improve performance
- stability â€” reduce flakiness / improve reliability
- feature â€” add new functionality
- techdebt â€” address known technical debt
- test â€” add or improve automated tests
- docs â€” documentation updates

**Priorities:**
- p0 â€” do now
- p1 â€” do soon
- p2 â€” do later

**Example:**
```
# TODO[refactor][p1]: Consolidate repeated waits into helper
```

All approved TODOs will be appended here in the **TODO Backlog** section.
