# compass-automation
This project automates Compass Mobile (Fleet Operations PWA) workflows using Python 3.13, Selenium, and pytest. It handles MVAs end-to-end: detecting open PM Work Items, completing them if found, or creating new Work Items by associating complaints, entering mileage, selecting opcodes, and finalizing.
