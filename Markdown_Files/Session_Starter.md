# Compass Automation - Session Starter

## Project Goal
Automate end-to-end Preventive Maintenance (PM) Work Item workflows in Compass Mobile PWA.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.13, Selenium, pytest
- Microsoft Edge + WebDriver

## Current State
- ✅ Login + MVA validation stable
- ✅ Dual-factor Data Integrity Auditor logic implemented (RENTABLE + 4000 gap)
- ✅ Gate 2 Verification flow documented (Create/Complete vs Verified)
- 🚧 Implementing Auditor logic in Python flows

## How We Work (Chat Reminders)
- Keep responses **concise**
- Default = **FAST MODE** (code-first, diffs preferred)
- Small changes only (≤20 LOC), one commit at a time
- Always suggest new branch before big changes
- Session logs are append-only, History is curated
- Prefer reusing helpers over adding new files

## Next Focus
- Harden mileage-based navigation and validation
- Improve reliability of complaint association
